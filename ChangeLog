2012-02-10 -- version 1.0
* myclippings by Cezary M. Kruk is based on parse_kindle_clippings by Mark
  Rajcok -- it reads Kindle's 4 or 3 "My Clippings.txt" file and stores
  clippings sorted by book/title in the separate files -- one file per a
  book/title -- or in a common file named "myclippings.txt".  The highlights,
  the notes, and the bookmarks entries stored in the generated files or file
  are preceded by the locations numbers.  The script output is highly
  customizable.
* it can read "My Clippings.txt" file using Kindle 4 or Kindle 3 format
  (see: the $kindle variable from the configuration section).
* it allows to generate the files using LF or CR-LF line breaks (see: the
  $system variable from the configuration section).
* it stores data in separate files for each book/title or in a common file
  (see: the $combine variable from the configuration section).
* it allows to skip the titles or to store them in the generated files or
  file (see: the $titles variable from the configuration section).
* it allows to store bookmarks or to skip them (see: the $bookmarks variable
  from the configuration section).
* it allows to store locations or to skip them (see: the $locations variable
  from the configuration section).
* it allows to integrate "myclippings.txt" file on the basis of "*.txt"
  files from the current directory (see: -i option).
* it allows to disintegrate "myclippings.txt" file into "*.txt" files (see:
  -d option).
* it allows to restore "My Clippings.txt" file on the basis of
  "myclippings.txt" file -- if it is necessary it restores "myclippings.txt"
  file on the basis of "*.txt" files from the current directory (see: -r
  option).
* the Linux version reads "My Clippings.txt" file from the current
  directory; the Windows version reads "My Clippings.txt" file from "My
  Documents" directory (see: the $system variable from the configuration
  section).
* the script can read the settings for the mentioned variables using the
  command line options and arguments.
* the script was tested in Slackware Linux 13.37 with Perl 5.12.3 as well as
  in Windows XP with ActivePerl 5.14.2 Build 1402 for MSWin32-x86 (see:
  http://www.perl.org/get.html)
